   <description value="A CodeSystem that identifies generic API error or warning codes in response to a request. The list is not exhaustive and many APIs will have an additional set of codes specific to their business logic and implementation.
                For publishers of APIs, we recommend that you use the code and display values in your API to make it more readable." />

  <concept>
    <code value="ACCESS_DENIED_LEVEL" />
    <display value="Access has been denied because you need higher level permissions" />
    <definition value="The request requires higher pemission levels than the authentication provided. For example NHS login has three main levels of P0, P5 and P9 - and the request held a P0 level, instead of P9" />

  <concept>
    <code value="ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED" />
    <display value="Access token has expired" />
    <definition value="Obtain a new access token - the provided access token has expired and is no longer valid, access tokens only have a short life time" />

  <concept>
    <code value="ACCESS_TOKEN_INVALID" />
    <display value="Authorization header not formatted correctly" />
    <definition value="The bearer token could not be retrieved from the Authorization header, format should be 'Bearer INSERT-ACCESS-TOKEN'" />

    <display value="Your connection has exceeded the rate limit" />
    <definition value="APIs have different rate limits - and your request has been rejected. Rate limits can be per application (connection) or per API. A detailed reason will be returned in the diagnoistics field. Wait a short period and re-try, ideally with an exponential back-off policy." />

    <code value="SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE" />
    <display value="Service failure - could be temporary" />
    <definition value="There has been a processing failure in the request chain. This could be tranisent failure for a single request, a temporary service issue or maintenance window. Re-send the request after the time specified in the Retry-After header." />

      <display value="Resource not found" />
      <definition value="The URL did not point to an existing resource. This could be a simple incorrect url path, or for some REST APIs this can equate to a person or prescription not existing in that API." />

      <display value="A required header is missing" />
      <definition value="Inform the caller which required header is missing in the request. Some APIs will return a list of missing headers, others will return the first one. If a list is returned, there will be one issue per error. " />
